**Linear Regression using Gradient Descent**

DATASET
Data taken from UCI ML Repository. The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the plant was set to work with full load.The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.

• Implemented gradient descent from scratch to predict the energy output of a power plant with an accuracy of 91%. 

• Tuned hyperparameters and compared the results with other numerical optimization methods

Satisfied with the result  as the R^2 score value is 0.9158
